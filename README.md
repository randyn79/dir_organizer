# dir_organizer (Directory Organizer)

Loops through each file in the current working directory, and based on the file extension, moves the files into a Documents, Images or Text folder inside the current working directory.  Ignores files with undefined extensions.  Skips files if the file already exists in the destination directory.

For my purposes, this was created to quickly organize my downloads folder or USB drive.  There are probably other applications this could be used for if modified.
